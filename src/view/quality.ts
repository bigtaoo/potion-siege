// a few seconds, up slowly after a long stable stretch. The browser does not expose the
// phone's temperature, but a hot phone throttles its CPU and GPU and its frames slow down, so
// frame rate stands in for heat. Auto never climbs above the start level.

// Screens with no battle on them (home, results) draw at the display's full density instead
// (frameResolution); a battle at its level's, never over 2. A 30 Hz display (an iPhone in Low
// Power Mode) is held on its level, not stepped down for frames it could never show (refreshCap).

 * skipped refresh every few seconds, and squeeze a short frame in after a late one.
 *
 * The refresh is read from the animation frames themselves: the last VSYNC_WINDOW gaps' time
 * over the refreshes they span, each gap a whole number of their median. iOS stamps a frame
 * when its callback runs, so a late callback is followed by an early one (24 ms then 9 on a
 * 60 Hz screen); the shortest gap would read that as a 110 Hz screen, call every ordinary frame
 * a missed refresh and tighten the gate. This estimate stays on the refresh through that
 * jitter and the odd missed refresh, and follows a screen that really slows down (a phone's
 * battery saver) within about a second. A frame passes
 * once the time since the last one passed is within GATE_SLACK refreshes of the cap's
 * interval, which leaves over half a refresh of room for timestamp jitter either way; after a
 * late frame the count starts again from it.
