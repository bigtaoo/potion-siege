// Drives the frame loop and applies quality levels (ported from standing's
// client/src/game/qualityRuntime.ts). Pixi's own ticker.maxFPS cannot be used: it still
// measures each frame's delta from the last skipped animation frame, so a 60 fps cap on a
// 120 Hz screen would run the game at half speed. Instead the ticker is stopped and stepped
// from our own requestAnimationFrame loop behind a FrameGate. Calm screens (no battle moving)
// get a lower cap, and their frames are left out of the governor's measure. The ticker runs on a
// FrameClock (as standing's), so the battle and the view step whole refreshes however late the
// frame's callback ran. Screens with no battle draw at the canvas's full density and battles at
// their level's resolution: the canvas is resized as the player goes in or out of a battle, never
// mid-battle (frameResolution). A frame that throws goes to onFault (game/faultRecover.ts).
