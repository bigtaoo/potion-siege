// A frame that throws (faultRecover.ts, ported from standing's ui/faultGuard.ts): one bad frame
// must never leave a frozen canvas, nor a broken device flood the collector. Each fault says
// whether to report it (once per REPORT_GAP_MS; the anomaly cap bounds the session too) and what
// to do: recover (settle the battle and put the home screen up afresh), wait (a recovery just
// ran, give its screen a moment), or, once recoveries stop helping (STRIKES of them inside
// STRIKE_MS), restart the page. Where it cannot restart (it restarted a moment ago and the fault
// came back), it rests for STRIKE_MS and then recovers again, so a fault hours later is still
// recovered and a fault on every frame never turns into a reload loop. Pure.
